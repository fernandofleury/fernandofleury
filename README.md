### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

You might have reached my profile looking for some interesting stuff I'm currently working on. While I love programming in general, I mostly dedicate my free hours to other hobbies (that actually help me recharge and work with programming ðŸ˜„). From time to time these hobbies will overlap with programming topics & studies, and therefore I might add something here, but in general expect mostly work related stuff!

If you are still interested in getting touch with me, please feel free to reach out at fernandofleuryg@gmail.com
